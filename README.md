# EyeSpy
2D Platformer created in 24Hours for a hackathon. Won the award "Most Creative". The Hackathon was about involving motion devices in games which resulted in my team of four using a Tobii eye-tracker. 
There are two versions EyeSpyMouseV and EyeSpyTobiiV
EyeSpyMouseV:Playable Without Eyetracker
EyeSpyTobiiV:Tobbii EyeTracker Required
