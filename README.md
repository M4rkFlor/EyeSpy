# EyeSpy
2D Platformer created in 24Hours for a hackathon. Won the award "Most Creative".<br />
The Hackathon was about involving motion devices in games which resulted in my team of four using a Tobii eye-tracker. <br />
There are two versions EyeSpyMouseV and EyeSpyTobiiV<br />
EyeSpyMouseV:Playable Without Eyetracker<br />
EyeSpyTobiiV:Tobbii EyeTracker Required<br />
